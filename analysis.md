# Overview
In this assignment, I was asked to select data from the Citi Bike program and create dashboards, in order to explore how Citi Bikes are used in New York City. In order to do this, I focused on data from the past year, from June 2022 to May 2023.

The data, as presented in this dashboard, has led me to the following conclusion: Citi Bikes tend to act as a supplement to public transportation, especially for the younger riders of New Jersey that have access to them. Of course, this conclusion is limited in its scope to the past year and may require data from the past several years to be verified as a long-standing trend. 

Moreover, I suggest there may be some reason to be wary of this data, how it was gathered, and perhaps how I parsed it. As my map of start stations shows, there were no Citi Bike rides started from New York City itself. According to the data, as shown in this dashboard, Citi Bike rides are only started from the participating cities in New Jersey. Although this may be demonstrated to be true, it is reason to be wary, as it is improbable that no riders in the City of New York started a bike ride over the course of an entire year.

# Overall Trends

Using the dashboards as a guide, we can understand the use of Citi Bikes as habitual and routine, rather than recreational. Judging by the 'Distribution' bar graphs on the 'Who Is Riding?' dashboard, members drive traffic to and from almost every Citi Bike station in the past year. The most major exception to this observation is 12 St & Sinatra Dr N, but the vast majority of stations receive most of their traffic from members. As a result, this indicates that Citi Bike traffic is driven by members, who account for thousands more rides than casual users throughout the year and are likely members because they expect to use Citi Bikes more habitually. In this way, we can understand Citi Bikes as a utility, since they act as an integral method of transportation for many riders.

Moreover, judging by the distribution of the top ten most-used end stations on the map of New York City and when they were used over the past year, we can understand their use as a supplement for public transportation. For destinations, eight of ten Citi Bike stops are near major transportation utilities, including Metro lines, bus lines, walking paths, parkways, and ferries. Some of these stops, and those that are not near marked transportation hubs, are near major public utilities like hospitals, City Hall in Hoboken, and parks. This indicates that riders are often using bikes to go about their daily errands and commutes.

However, creating these visualizations has left me with some concerns. For example, I find it improbable that no Citi bike rides were started in New York City, and that so many stations in the city had as little as a single visit as a destination, over past year. Despite these concerns, my explanation is that a greater variety and presence of public transportation in New York could explain this trend. In New Jersey, riders seem to use Citi Bikes as a way to get from their starting places to public transportation, then from public transportation to their destination. Judging by the maps, it seems those who are traveling in New York can simply count on being more proximal to public transportation, so they don't need anything to bridge a gap.  

# Conclusions

In conclusion, we can understand Citi Bike as an important utility and as a supplement to other utilities, especially in participationg communities in New Jersey. According to the data that is available from last year, Citi Bike's use is driven by daily users, who are Citi Bike members. In fact, Citi Bikes are underused in the city limits of New York, probably because other forms of transportation are more convenient. To increase use, Citi Bike should target leisurely riders in New York, such as tourists. With subway stops at every corner, Citi Bikes are unlikely to be used as a utility in New York, in the same way as they are in New Jersey. However, much of the upkeep of Citi Bike stations and bike replacement will need to focus on New Jersey because Citi Bikes have become an important utility there.
